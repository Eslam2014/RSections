## Graphics in R

---
## Today’s Lab 

* Introduction to Graphics in R 
* Examples of commonly used graphics functions
* Common options for customizing graphs 

---
## Computer Graphics 
- Graphics are important for conveying important features of the data
- They can be used to examine
    - Marginal distributions*
    - Relationships between variables
    - Summary of very large data
- Important complement to many statistical and computational techniques

---
## Example Data 

To view available datasets, type:

```r
data()
```
To load a dataset into memory, type data(name of data set)

```
data(ChickWeight) 
```
To view the loaded dataset type its name: 
```
ChickWeight 
```

## Graphics in R 
- `Plot()` is the main graphing function

- Automatically produces simple plots for vectors, functions or data frames

- Many useful customization options…

---
## Plotting a Vector 
plot(v) will print the elements of the vector v according to their index

---

```r
# Plot weight for each observation
plot(ChickWeight$weight)
```

![plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-4](figure/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png)

---

```r
# Plot weight against their ranks
plot(sort(ChickWeight$weight))
```

![plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-5](figure/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png)

---
## Common Parameters for plot()

- Specifying labels:
    - main – provides a title
    - xlab – label for the x axis
    - ylab – label for the y axis
- Specifying range limits:
    - ylim – 2-element vector gives range for y axis
    - xlim – 2-element vector gives range for x axis

---
## A Labeled Plot 

```r
plot(sort(ChickWeight$weight), ylim = c(50,200), ylab = "Weight", xlab = "Rank", main = "Distribution of Weights")
```

![plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-6](figure/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png)

---
# Plotting Two Vectors
* plot() can pair elements from 2 vectors to produce x-y coordinates
* You can exclude vectors using:
```
plot(datasetname[-c(1,2)])
```

---
## Plotting Two Vectors 

```r
plot(ChickWeight$Diet, ChickWeight$weight, xlab = "diet", ylab = "Weight",
     main = 'Type of Diet Effect on Weight', col = "blue")
```

![plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-7](figure/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png)

---
## Plotting Contents of a Dataset 

```r
plot(ChickWeight)
```

![plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-8](figure/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png)

---
## Plotting Contents of a Dataset 

```r
plot(ChickWeight[-c(1)])
```

![plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-9](figure/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png)

---
## Histograms
* A diagram consisting of rectangles whose area is proportional to the frequency of a variable
* The parameter breaks is key:
    - Specifies the number of categories to plot
    - Specifies the breakpoints for each category
* The xlab, ylab, xlim, ylim options work as expected

---
## Histograms

```r
hist(ChickWeight$weight, col = "lightblue", xlab = "Weight", main = "Weight Histogram")
```

![plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-10](figure/unnamed-chunk-10-1.png)

---
## Histograms With Breaks 

```r
hist(ChickWeight$weight, col = "lightblue", xlab = "Weight", 
     main = "Weight Histogram", breaks = seq (0,400, by=10) )
```

![plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-11](figure/unnamed-chunk-11-1.png)

---
## Boxplots
- Generated by the boxplot() function
- Draws plot summarizing
    - Median
    - Quartiles (Q1, Q3)*
    - Outliers – by default, observations more than 1.5 * (Q1 – Q3) distant from nearest quartile

---

```r
boxplot(ChickWeight, col = rainbow(6), ylab = "ChickWeight Boxplot")
```

![plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-12](figure/unnamed-chunk-12-1.png)

---
## Boxplot for Weight 
* `rug()` can add a tick for each observation to the side of a `boxplot()` and other plots.

* The side parameter specifies where tick marks are drawn.

---

```r
boxplot(ChickWeight$weight, col = rainbow(6), ylab = "ChickWeight Boxplot")
rug(ChickWeight$weight,side=2)
```

![plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-13](figure/unnamed-chunk-13-1.png)

---
## Customizing Plots 
- R provides a series of functions for adding text, lines and points to a plot
- We will illustrate some useful ones, but look at demo(graphics) for more examples
- Type `<Return>` or Press enter for more

---
## Drawing on a plot 
* To add additional data use
    - points(x,y)
    - lines(x,y)
* For freehand drawing use
    - polygon()
    - rect()

---
## Text Drawing 
* Two commonly used functions:
    - text() – writes inside the plot region, could be used to label datapoints
    - mtext() – writes on the margins

---
## Plotting Two Data Series 
```
x <- seq(0,2*pi, by = 0.1)
y <- sin(x)
y1 <- cos(x)
plot(x,y, col = "green", type = "l", lwd = 3)
lines(x,y1, col = "red", lwd = 3)
mtext("Sine and Cosine Plot", side = 3, line = 1)
```

---
![plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-14](figure/unnamed-chunk-14-1.png)

---
## Adding a Label & Rectangle 
```
rect(0,-1,2,0.5)
text(1,0.6, "label here")
```
![plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-15](figure/unnamed-chunk-15-1.png)

---
## Plotting Functions 
```
f <- function(x) x * (x + 1) / 2
x <- 1:20
y <- f(x)
plot(x, y)
mtext("Plotting the expression", side = 3, line = 2.5)
mtext(expression(y == sum(i,1,x,i)), side = 3, line = 0)
mtext("The first variable", side = 1, line = 3)
mtext("The second variable", side = 2, line = 3)
```

---
## Multiple Plots on a Page
- Set the mfrow or mfcol options
- Take 2 dimensional vector as an argument
    - The first value specifies the number of rows
    - The second specifies the number of columns
- The 2 options differ in the order individual plots are printed

---
## Multiple Plots on a Page 


```r
par(mfcol = c(3,1))
hist(ChickWeight  $weight*1000, breaks = 10, main = "Weight (in mg)", xlab = "Weight")
hist(ChickWeight$weight, breaks = 10, main = "Weight (in g)", xlab = "Weight")
hist(ChickWeight$weight/1000,breaks = 10, main = "Weight (in kg)", xlab = "Weight")
```

![plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-17](figure/unnamed-chunk-17-1.png)

---
## Saving R Plots

* R usually generates output to the screen
* R can also save its graphics output in a file that you can distribute or include in a document prepared with Word or `LATEX` . From `File -> Save As`

---
## Practice
### Plot two graphs as follows: 
* Plot1: Histogram of ChickWeight weight vector (in kgs instead of grams). Having main label “Weight in Kgs” and 8 breaks.  

* Plot 2: the box plot of the Weight vector in Kgs in red color.
Two plots in the same row

---
## Solution

```r
hist(ChickWeight$weight/100, breaks=20, main = "Weight (in kg)", xlab = "Weight")
```

![plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-18](figure/unnamed-chunk-18-1.png)

---

```r
boxplot(ChickWeight$weight/100, col = "red")
```
